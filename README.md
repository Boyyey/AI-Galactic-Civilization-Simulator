## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-galactic-civ-sim.git
   cd ai-galactic-civ-sim
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the interactive dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## 🖥️ Dashboard Guide

The interactive dashboard provides full control over the simulation:

1. **Galaxy Map**: 3D visualization of the galaxy with civilizations and their territories
2. **Stats & Network**: Real-time statistics and trade/diplomacy network visualization
3. **Resource Heatmap**: View resource distribution across the galaxy
4. **Civilizations**: Detailed information about each civilization, including:
   - Population and technology levels
   - Government and cultural traits
   - Historical events and achievements
   - Technology tree progress
5. **Event Log**: Chronological record of all significant simulation events

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
- Modern web browser for the dashboard interface

## 📚 Documentation

### Simulation Parameters
- **Galaxy Size**: Number of stars in the galaxy (100-5000)
- **Civilization Count**: Number of starting civilizations (1-50)
- **Simulation Steps**: Duration of the simulation (in thousands of years)
- **Random Events**: Toggle for cosmic events and random occurrences

### Scenario Presets
- **Default**: Balanced settings for general use
- **Crowded Galaxy**: Many civilizations in a dense galaxy
- **Sparse Life**: Few civilizations with vast distances between them
- **Warzone**: High aggression and competition for resources
- **Peaceful Era**: Cooperative civilizations with low aggression

## 🛣 Roadmap
- [x] Core galaxy and civilization simulation
- [x] Basic diplomacy and trade systems
- [x] Technology tree implementation
- [x] Interactive dashboard with 3D visualization
- [ ] Advanced AI decision making
- [ ] More detailed economic systems
- [ ] Cultural evolution and language development
- [ ] Multiplayer support
